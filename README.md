void setup () {
  Wash away the anger
    Here I stand beneath the warm and soothing rain
      The droplets falling gently down on the terrain
        Wash away the sorrow, all the stains of time
          But there's no memory, it's only dry inside
            In the mud and sinking deeper into a peaceful life

  }

void update () {
  And it will come like a flood of pain pouring down on me
    And it will not let up until the end is here
      And it will come through the darkest day, in my final hour
        And it will never rest until the clouds are clear
          Until it finds my dreams have disappeared

  }
