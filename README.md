# Hola-mon
Hola! Som en James de es team rocket
Es programadors me mataran, no se programar (es per un treball xD)

void setup () {
  I've come here from nowhere
  Across the unforgiving sea
  Drifting further and further
  It's all becoming clear to me
    
    But violent winds are upon us and I can't sleep
    Internal temperatures rising and all the voices won't recede
    
 }

void update () {
  I've finally found what I was looking for
  A place where I can be without remorse
  Because I am a stranger who has found an even stranger war
  I've finally found what I was looking for

    Here I come
  
  I sharpen the knife and look down upon the bay
  For all of my life a stranger I remain
  A stranger I remain
  A stranger I remain
  
}
